        "content": "Feedback from massive stars plays a key role in molecular cloud evolution. After the onset of star formation, the young stellar population is exposed by photoionization, winds, supernovae, and radiation pressure from massive stars. Recent observations of nearby galaxies have pro- vided the evolutionary timeline between molecular clouds and exposed young stars, but the duration of the embedded phase of massive star formation is still ill-constrained. We measure how long massive stellar populations remain embedded within their natal cloud, by applying a statistical method to six nearby galaxies at 20\u2212100 pc resolution, using CO, Spitzer 24\u00b5m, and H\u03b1 emission as tracers of molecular clouds, embedded star formation, and exposed star formation, respectively. We find that the embedded phase (with CO and 24\u00b5m emission) lasts for 2\u22127 Myr and constitutes 17\u221247% of the cloud lifetime. During approximately the first half of this phase, the region is invisible in H\u03b1, making it heavily obscured. For the second half of this phase, the region also emits in H\u03b1 and is partially exposed. Once the cloud has been dispersed by feedback, 24\u00b5m emission no longer traces ongoing star formation, but remains detectable for another 2\u22129 Myr through the emission from ambient CO-dark gas, tracing star formation that recently ended. The short duration of massive star formation suggests that pre- supernova feedback (photoionization and winds) is important in disrupting molecular clouds. The measured timescales do not show significant correlations with environmental properties (e.g. metallicity). Future JWST observations will enable these measurements routinely across the nearby galaxy population.",

As a result, H\u03b1 emission is heavily or partially obscured due to the extinction provided by the dust in dense gas surrounding the young stars. Despite this, on-going star formation is detectable us- ing mid-infrared, hydrogen infrared recombination lines, radio re- combination lines, and free-free radio continuum emission (Lock- man 1989; Kennicutt 1998a; Calzetti et al. 2005; Kennicutt et al. 2007; Prescott et al. 2007; Murphy et al. 2011; Vutisalchavakul & Evans 2013; Querejeta et al. 2019). In particular, the 24\u00b5m emis- sion in the mid-infrared observed by the Multiband Imaging Pho- tometer (MIPS) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope provides an unbiased tracer of embedded massive star formation (e.g. see Ken- nicutt & Evans 2012 for review), as long as the star-forming region has a fully sampled initial mass function (Vutisalchavakul & Evans 2013). 24\u00b5m emission originates from stochastically heated small dust grains that do not require ionizing photons to be excited but do empirically correlate with tracers of massive star formation and so can be used as a tracer of the presence of large amounts of dust- reprocessed photospheric light from massive stars. Therefore, the 24\u00b5m emission is assumed to turn on only once massive stars are present.

Considering that supernova explosions are expected 4 \u2212 20 Myr after massive stars are formed (Leitherer et al. 2014; Chevance et al. 2020a), the short duration of overlapping CO and H\u03b1 emis- sion suggests that pre-supernova feedback, such as photoionization and stellar winds, is important for disrupting star-forming molec- ular clouds (Chevance et al. 2020a, also see Barnes et al. 2020). Ward et al. (2020b) have also used this method and extended the evolutionary timeline of star-forming regions by incorporating Hi emission to trace atomic gas. The measured atomic gas cloud life- time in the LMC is \u223c50 Myr and almost no overlap with the ex- posed star-forming phase is detected.",

        "content": "In this paper, we go a step further in the characterisation of the GMC evolutionary lifecycle and use CO, 24\u00b5m, and H\u03b1 emis- sion as tracers for molecular gas, embedded star formation, and ex- posed star formation, respectively, for six nearby galaxies (IC342, LMC, M31, M33, M51, and NGC300). Previous applications of the statistical method to the same galaxies have focused on char- acterising the GMC lifecycle using CO emission as a tracer of the molecular gas and H\u03b1 emission as a tracer of the young massive stars(NGC300:Kruijssenetal.2019;M51:Chevanceetal.2020c; M33: Hygate 2020; and the LMC: Ward et al. 2020a). We derive novel measurements of the GMC lifetimes in IC342 and M31 in this paper (see Appendix B); these are based on CO and H\u03b1 obser- vations presented in Schruba et al. (2021a,b). Employing Spitzer 24\u00b5m observations allows us to probe the earliest phase of star for- mation where the stars are still heavily obscured, and quantify how long it takes young star-forming regions to emerge from their na- tal cloud (at which point the Hii regions created by their ionizing radiation become visible).",

For the LMC, the observations were conducted as a follow-up study of the NANTEN survey (Fukui et al. 2008) by targeting a subset of previously identified molec- ular clouds (\u223c160 out of 272 clouds), with an improved resolution in order to resolve the GMCs (\u223c11 pc). In Figure 1, white dotted lines show the coverage of the MAGMA survey and solid white circles indicate regions where molecular gas has been detected by the NANTEN survey, but not further targeted with the MAGMA survey. We exclude these white circled regions, where we know GMCs exist, from our analysis2. However, we still include other regions not observed by the MAGMA survey, which might have diffuse and faint CO emission. We note that the inclusion of these sight lines, not covered by the MAGMA survey, should have a neg- ligible impact on our results because diffuse and faint emission is eventually removed in our analysis through a filtering process (see Section 3). Moreover, the MAGMA survey covers most (\u223c80%) of the total CO emission from the LMC observed by the NAN- TEN survey (Wong et al. 2011). The observed CO emission from the MAGMA survey also shows good agreement with the molec- ular gas map produced using dust continuum emission modelling (Jameson et al. 2016), indicating that we cover most of the emis- sion from GMCs. The resulting angular resolution of the MAGMA CO data is 45(cid:48)(cid:48), and the sensitivity is 0.3 K per 0.526 km s\u22121 veloc- ity channel.

A gap is defined to exist when the nth peak is more than twice as bright as the (n+1)th peak. Whenever a gap is found, we mask all the peaks that are brighter than the (n+1)th brightest peak. As a result, we mask three star-forming regions each in the LMCandinM33beforeapplyingouranalysis(greencirclesinFig- ure1).Theseregionsinclude30DoradusintheLMCandNGC604 in M33, which alone contribute more than 30% of the 24\u00b5m emis- sionofeachgalaxy.Notethatwewouldbemaskingthesamepeaks unless we go down to a brightness difference of 50% (rather than 100%) when defining a gap in the luminosity function. In this case, we would be masking one to four more peaks each in IC342, M31, andNGC300.Theimpactofmaskingsuchbrightregionsonthere- sulting derived parameters is generally small when averaging over the entire galaxy, but becomes significant if a smaller fraction of the galaxy is considered (see Ward et al. 2020a for the effect of 30 DoradusontheLMCandChevanceetal.2020cfortheeffectofthe \u201cheadlight cloud\u201d on the spiral galaxy NGC628, also see Herrera et al. 2020).

The fundamental concept of our method is that such re- gions are independently undergoing their evolution, from molec- ular clouds to the formation of stars. These evolutionary phases are observed using gas (e.g. CO) and SFR tracers (e.g. H\u03b1 or 24\u00b5m). We define the duration of each phase based on the visi- bility timescale of the tracers used. The timescale during which a gas emission tracer and an SFR tracer co-exist corresponds to the duration of massive star formation plus the time it takes to dis- rupt its natal molecular gas by stellar feedback (i.e. the feedback timescale, t ). In the following, the cloud lifetime will be denoted fb as t , the star formation tracer lifetime as t or t , and the CO H\u03b1 24\u00b5m feedback timescale as t or t depending on the SFR tracer fb,H\u03b1 fb,24\u00b5m used.",

As the cloud collapses and starts forming stars, the region becomes visible both in the gas and SFR tracers. Eventually, the remaining molecular gas is dispersed by stellar feedback and the region is only visible in the SFR tracers. Locally, the gas-to-SFR flux ratio therefore de- creases with time during the evolution of a cloud. Observationally, when focusing on a non-star-forming GMC, a higher gas-to-SFR flux ratio is measured compared to the large-scale (\u223c1 kpc) aver- age gas-to-SFR flux ratio. By contrast, when focusing on a young star-forming region, where most of the molecular gas has been dis- persed, a lower gas-to SFR flux ratio is measured.

This large-scale emission potentially includes dif- fuse emission originating from sources related to the recent mas- sive star formation, such as low mass molecular clouds, low lumi- nosity Hii regions, and ionizing photons that have escaped from Hii regions (e.g. Wood et al. 2010; F. Belfiore et al. in prepa- ration). It may also originate from other mechanisms not related to recent massive star formation, for example, diffuse molecular gas, infrared emission powered by stars of intermediate age, and diffuse ionized gas created by shocks (Martin 1997; Leroy et al. 2012).WeremovesuchdiffuseemissioninbothgasandSFRtracer emission maps iteratively, using the method presented in Hygate et al. (2019), which makes the derived timescales sensitive to only the massive/luminous molecular clouds and young stellar popula- tions. This method filters emission on spatial scales larger than n \u03bb times the typical distance between regions \u03bb (as measured from the HEISENBERG code) using a Gaussian high-pass filter in Fourier space. For each galaxy, we adopt the smallest possible value for n \u03bb, while ensuring the flux loss from the compact emission to be less than 10% (also following Chevance et al. 2020c; Hygate 2020; see Table 2). We do not adopt a fixed filtering scale because we want to maximise the removal of diffuse emission, while minimis- ingtheimpactofthefilteringonthecompactregions.Theinfluence of n \u03bb on the derived timescales is fully described in Hygate et al. (2019) and Hygate (2020). In summary, the choice of n \u03bb does not significantly change the best-fitting model parameters, as long as theadoptedn \u03bb issmallerthan30andthefluxlossfromthecompact emission is less than 10%. After the diffuse emission is filtered out, a noise mask with a threshold at twice the standard deviation noise level of the emission map is applied. We repeat this process until the convergence condition is reached, which is when the change of the measured value of \u03bb is less than 5% over three consecutive iterations.",

(2018). We use Clumpfind (Williams et al. 1994) to identify gas and SFR tracer peaks in each map. This algorithm finds peaks by drawing closed contours for a set of flux levels, within a given flux range (\u2206log 10F) below the maximum flux level, with an interval of \u03b4log 10F between flux levels. The adopted values for our sample are summarised in Ta- ble 2. Moreover, to avoid identifying point sources that are likely to be foreground stars that were not masked during the image re- duction process or externally illuminated starless dust clumps (see Section 5.3), we only accept peaks that contain more than N pix,min pixels. The area of N pix,min pixels equals 0.2\u22123.5 times the coarsest beam size. We note that our choices of \u2206log 10F, \u03b4log 10F, N pix,min, l ap,max,and N ap donotaffectourmeasurementssignificantlyaslong as peaks that are obviously visible in the emission maps have been identified (Kruijssen et al. 2018).

However, since we ref additionally mask some of the bright star-forming regions for the reasons explained in Section 2.3, we re-run the same analysis using H\u03b1 as an SFR tracer with updated masks. Our measurements us- ing H\u03b1 as an SFR tracer are listed in Table 3, and are in very good agreement with (or identical to) the previously published results.

The measured short feedback timescales indicate that pre-supernova feedback such as photoionization and stellar winds are mostly responsible for the dispersal of molecular clouds.

This is further discussed in Section 5.2. Radiation magneto- hydrodynamic simulations of GMCs by Kim et al. (2020) suggest a similar duration of the star formation and feedback timescales (4 \u2212 8 Myr). The measured duration for embedded star formation is somewhat shorter than the age spread of star clusters in the LMC (7 \u2212 12 Myr) measured by Efremov & Elmegreen (1998), on the scale of the mean radius of SFR tracer peaks (\u223c10 \u2212 50 pc). This is expected as the actual size of a star-forming region is necessar- ily smaller than the size of a SFR tracer peak, which is limited by the spatial resolution of our maps. The agreement gets better if we only consider the age spreads measured among young stellar clus- ters (1\u22124 Myr; from star clusters with ages of 1\u221210 Myr).",

A similar duration of the highly embedded star-forming phase has recently been reported by Elmegreen & Elmegreen (2019, 2020), where such a phase is suggested to last for 1 \u2212 2 Myr based on the mass measurement of star-forming cores in nearby spiral galaxies using 8\u00b5m emission. The measurement of 2.4 Myr for the heav- ily obscured phase using a cloud classification method by Corbelli et al. (2017) also supports the values we obtain here (see more in Section 5.2).",

We do not find any statistically significant trend, which is defined to exist when the correlation coefficient is positive or negative with 95% probability. While this is not shown in Figure 4, we also found no statisticallysignificantcorrelationwiththegalaxy-averagedmolec- ular gas surface density (\u03a3 gas). However, we note that t 24\u00b5m and t iso,24\u00b5m appeartobesomewhatshortertowardsincreasingmetallic- ity and decreasing star formation efficiency. While it is difficult to distinguish what is driving this trend, as metallicity and star forma- tion efficiency are correlated in our sample of galaxies, we suspect that metallicity could be the primary driver of this trend. Indeed, winds from massive stars become more energetic with increasing metallicity (Maeder 1992), resulting in a faster dispersal of the sur- rounding gas and decay of t emission. We note that one might 24\u00b5m expect to see longer (isolated) 24\u00b5m emitting timescale for metal- rich galaxies since the dust-to-gas ratio correlates with metallicity (Re\u00b4my-Ruyer et al. 2014). This is not what we find here, which can be explained by our use of relative changes of gas-to-SFR tracer flux ratio compared to the galactic average, instead of using abso- lute flux ratios, when constraining the timeline of GMC evolution.",

Using multi-wavelength data of the LMC and syn- 24\u00b5m CO thetic stellar population models, Harris & Zaritsky (2009) studied the star formation history in the LMC and found a roughly consis- tent SFR during the duration of the whole evolutionary cycle. The criterion is also satisfied in M33 and NGC300 as shown by Kang et al. (2012, 2016) using chemical evolution models to reconstruct the star formation rate history. Using data from the PHAT survey, the recent star formation history of M31 is confirmed to be qui- escent without significant variations (Lewis et al. 2015; Williams et al. 2017). By performing spectral energy distribution fitting to the multi-wavelength data of M51, the SFR in M51 is also mea- sured to be roughly constant for the last 100 Myr (Eufrasio et al. 2017). The star formation history of IC342 is not known. How- ever, we do not expect it to experience significant variations in the global star formation rate during the last \u223c30 Myr when averaged over t = 8 Myr. In addition, we mask the starburst nucleus 24\u00b5m of this galaxy, which experienced a major burst of star formation \u223c60 Myr ago (Bo\u00a8ker et al. 1999).",

(2017) find that the C-type phase in M33 lasts for 8 Myr (without quoted uncertainty), which is in excellent agreement with our mea- surement of 8.4+3.6 \u22123.0 Myr. For the duration of the heavily obscured phase of star formation (CO and 24\u00b5m emission without H\u03b1; re- ferred to as B-type), Corbelli et al. (2017) find 2.4 Myr, which is similar to the duration we measure, not only for M33 (3.5+1.2 \u22121.9 Myr), but for most of the galaxies in our sample (1.4 \u2212 3.8 Myr; see Sec- tion 4.2). Lastly, as for the duration of the inactive phase (referred to as A-type), we measure t \u2212 t = 7.7+1.4 \u22121.7 Myr, which is CO fb,24\u00b5m",

Calzetti et al. (2015) have measured ages of young massive star clusters in the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC5253 by applying SED modeling techniques on UV-optical-near infrared Hubble Space Telescope photometry. While the star clusters have ages spanning from 1 to 15 Myr, the age estimate of one very heavily attenuated cluster with a clear near-infrared excess indicates that the duration of the heavily ob- scured phase of star formation is longer than (or similar to) 1 Myr for this particular star-forming region. Whitmore et al. (2014) used free-free radio continuum emission to detect heavily obscured star- forming regions, and charaterised the evolutionary timeline from quiescent molecular clouds to exposed star-forming phase using age estimates from SED fitting of young stellar regions in the over- lap region of the merging Antennae galaxies. The duration of the heavily obscured phase (referred to as Stage 2 in Whitmore et al. 2014) and the feedback timescale (including the embedded phase; referred to as Stage 3 in Whitmore et al. 2014) are measured to be 0.1\u22121 Myr and 1\u22123 Myr, somewhat shorter than the duration we measure with 24\u00b5m, which are 1 \u2212 4 Myr and 2 \u2212 7 Myr, respec- tively. We note that this difference could be because (i) the mea- surements arefor galaxies undergoing amerger, unlike our sample; (ii) a different tracer is used to trace embedded star formation; and (iii)ageestimatesinhighlyextinctedregionshaveconsiderableun- certainties (Hollyhead et al. 2015).",

In order to test whether the inclusion of 24\u00b5m emission from older stars and dust clumpscouldbiasourresults,wemaskthesesourcesandrepeatour analysis of the LMC. When masking dust clumps, we mask all the probable candidates in Seale et al. (2014) as it is difficult to distin- guish whether these clumps harbour deeply embedded stars or are heated by external radiation. We find that the older stars and dust clumps have a negligible effect on our results. In practice, older stars and dust clumps are not usually identified as SFR tracer peaks in our analysis due to their low brightness and small size, which does not satisfy the requirement of a minimum number of pixels to be identified as a peak in our method.",

        "content": "In Figure B2, we show the measured deviations of the en- closed gas-to-SFR flux ratios in apertures centred on CO and H\u03b1 peaks, compared to the galactic average, together with our best- fitting model. Table 3 lists the constrained quantities for the best- fittingmodel.Wehaveverifiedtheaccuracyofthesemeasurements in Section 5.1. As seen in our results using 24\u00b5m as an SFR tracer, we find a spatial de-correlation between gas and SFR tracer emis- sion peaks. We measure cloud lifetimes of 20.0+ \u22122 2. .0 3 Myr for IC342 and 14.0+2.1 \u22121.9 Myr for M31. The measured cloud lifetimes are within the range of our previous measurements of other galaxies where GMCs are found to live for 10 \u2212 30 Myr (Kruijssen et al. 2019; Chevanceetal.2020c;Hygate2020;Wardetal.2020a;Zabeletal. 2020). We suspect that the difference between the two cloud life- times are related to the different environments in which the molec- ular clouds are located, as recently suggested by Chevance et al. (2020c). In this case, the cloud evolution in IC342, which has a high molecular gas surface density (9.55 M pc\u22122), is likely to (cid:12) be governed by galactic dynamical processes, whereas internal dy- namics such as free-fall and crossing times are the determinant fac-",

The duration over which (cid:12) CO and H\u03b1 emission overlap is short (2.2+0.4 \u22120.5 Myr in IC342 and 1.1+0.3 \u22120.2 Myr in M31), as seen in previous measurements of other galaxies (Chevance et al. 2020a). These short feedback timescales indicate that molecular clouds are destroyed shortly after the star- forming region becomes exposed, making them visible in H\u03b1. Fi- nally, we find that independent star-forming regions are separated by 120+10 \u221210 pc in IC342 and 181+28 \u221219 pc in M31, comparable to our measurements with 24\u00b5m as an SFR tracer, as well as our previous findings with H\u03b1 for different galaxies.",
